Works via Shunting Yard parser to convert into PRN and then evaluates. Supports Square equations as of now. Unary operators supported.

To-Do:

Automatic Phrase Detector (prototypes already present in code, remaining is conversion with error tolerance)
Anti-pedantics pedantifier [eg. 5(3+2) -> 5*(3+2)]
Graphs
Working with augmentable variables

Modes to add:
Geometric and arithmetic series
Logic
Truth statements (seperate from logic, as in 5 = 5 T or 5 = 4 ê“•)
Trigonometric and other functions and their parsers
